Final notes on the Basic exercises in C

I had fun. This is the most important value of these exercises. I was
able to concentrate on problem solving with simple problems for the
first time in my life. I am forever grateful for this.

However, many of the exercises were poorly written. Sometimes I could
not understand the text of the exercise, at other times the sample data
contradicted the text. In the future I am going to use better sources.

So, to weigh the pros and cons of this adventure: It was great and I not
only began the beautiful way of systematic problem solving and
programming but also learnt to appreciate the effort put into problem
making and selecting suitable problem sources. Thanks for the
opportunity!
